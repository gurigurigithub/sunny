<p id="honbun">Hello, my name is Janina.
I am from Europe. My parents from Lithuania but raised in Denmark.
I graduated from The Necessary Teacher Training College in Denmark. Where I became a licensed teacher.

For 5 years I worked with Autism and ADHD spectrum students.
Since I came to Japan in 2019. I worked in Miyazaki kindergarten and Oita
International Pre-school as a homeroom teacher.

I am a nature child and love the arts. I have a few hobbies I have: are
film photography and hiking/camping in the mountains.

Learning a new language is one of the best ways to stimulate a child’s
cognitive and personal growth. So, let’s learn together!</p>

<h2>Mr.</h2>
<p id="honbun">My name is Bram and I am from The Netherlands.
I started working at New World International School in 2007. In 2010, I embarked on an adventure in Singapore, where I have taught young children for seven years until I returned to Japan. I am happy to be back at NWIS!
With a background in arts and design, I can teach math, language, science and more, in a creative, unique and fun way, hence my nickname “Mad Professor”. I hope to instill fun in learning and teaching children to become independent. And +most importantly… Keep laughing!</p>

<h2>Mr.</h2>
<p id="honbun">I come from the land down under… the continent, country, and island nation known as Australia!
Prior to joining NWIS, I had a background in writing, directing, editing TV commercials, and have applied that past knowledge to my teaching style, over the past decade, for young children in Japan. My communication with children is calm but entertaining, allowing children to lead themselves to make exciting and fun discoveries; a growing collection of original songs for children I've composed, help them find their own voice; and creative use of developing art, presenting stories, setting activities, and playing games, make math and language time feel like a day at the amusement park!
There's a rumour circling around that I never, ever tell jokes… It's true! Haha! Most of the time, I tell bad jokes.</p>

<h2>Miss</h2>
<p id="honbun">I am from Paris, France.
I was always attracted to teaching since I was a teenager. I started teaching career as a private English and Math teacher back in France and a preschool teacher for 3 years in Tokyo. I’m good at communicating and understanding quickly what children need.
I love walking a lot and cooking in my free time!</p>
